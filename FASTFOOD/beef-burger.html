        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Â½ tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 x 500g pack British Beef Steak Mince 15% fat</li>
            <li>1 tsp mixed dried herbs</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>4 slices mature Cheddar (optional)</li>
            <li>4 white rolls</li>
            <li>few round lettuce leaves, torn</li>

        <br>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands, shape into 4 patties.</li>
            <li>Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 5-6 minutes on each side. While the second side is cooking, lay a slice of cheese on top to melt slightly (if using).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the barbecue. Fill with the lettuce, burgers and tomato slices. Serve with ketchup, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
