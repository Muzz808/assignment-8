        <ul>
            <li><b>Chicken: </b>Use medium-sized chicken pieces that weigh 750 grams. (Live chicken weighs 1-1.25 kg) Smaller chicken has tender meat. The bigger bird would require longer marination of at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li><b>Wet spices: </b>The wet spices are ginger, garlic, green chili, and papaya paste on the round plate. Papaya paste is used as a meat tenderizer.</li>
            <li><b>Common Indian spices:</b>Tikka doesn't require tons of spices like achari chicken. The dry spices are common Indian spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, salt, red chili flakes, and Kashmiri chili powder.</li>

        <h4>HOW TO MAKE IT?</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak chicken in vinegar and salt solution for 20 minutes. Pro Tip: This helps clean the chicken and removes the blood in the chicken leg. You can read more about washing chicken on Cookist.com.</li>
            <li>Wash the chicken thoroughly after soaking and pat dry. Now, pierce the chicken with a fork. Then insert deep cuts across the grain. The cuts should be deep and the knife should touch the bone of the chicken.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients of marination in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Apply all over the chicken and marinate overnight in the fridge. Or keep for 4-6 hours at room temperature in a cool place. Cover the pot with mesh or thin cloth to allow air circulation if kept out of the fridge.</li>
            <li>Cook tikka in a wide pot on medium-high heat for 10-15 minutes. Cover the pot while cooking. Then burn excess water on high heat.
                <br> <b>Pro Tip 1: </b>Do not overcook tikka, the meat shouldn't come off the bones. If the tikka is fully cooked and there is still water left in the masala.
                <br>Remove chicken pieces and keep them on a separate plate. Then burn excess water on high heat. Apply the dry masala over the chicken but do not overdo it.
                <br> <b>Pro Tip 2: </b>If you have any excess masala save it to make chicken tikka both or chicken tikka masala or add it to any sauce.</li>
                <li><b>To smoke: </b>Place tikka in a wide pot with a tight lid. Put a piece of foil or a small metal bowl in the center of the pot. Now, heat charcoal on high flame until red hot then transfer coal carefully with the help of tongs to a pan. Drizzle little oil over the coal and cover the lid tightly to trap the smoke. Smoke for 7-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Now heat the smoked tikka on the direct flame until crispy and serve. Or alternatively, you can grill tikka will little oil on a grill pan until slightly crispy. Grill on low heat.
                    <br><b>Pro Tip:</b> You can place the grill on the flame and grill 2-3 tikka together. Freshly tikka tastes best because most juices are locked in. Reheating can dry out the juices but they still taste delicious.</li>
