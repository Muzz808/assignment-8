            <h4>INGREDIENTS YOU’LL NEED</h4>
            <br><br>
            <p>This Chicken Karahi recipe requires simple ingredients commonly used in South Asian cooking. Here are a few things to note:</p>
            <img src="CK Images/Chicken-Karahi-Ingredients.webp" alt="Ingredients">
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>OIL/GHEE: </b>I’ve used oil for fluidity and ghee for taste. This recipe doesn’t require as much oil as most Karahis, but you can increase the oil or ghee as desired for a more restaurant-like finish.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>TYPE OF TOMATOES USED IN KARAHI: </b>The tomatoes are the star ingredient in chicken karahi, so it’s important to use ripe, tasty ones. I’ve tried this recipe with both Roma and vine tomatoes and they both work well. However, I prefer Roma because vine tomatoes can sometimes add too much moisture while cooking the curry. When in doubt, go for the tastiest tomatoes available.</li>
                <li><b>CHICKEN CUTS AND USING BONELESS CHICKEN: </b>Traditionally, Karahi is made from a cut up whole chicken. One tip regarding the chicken cuts is to make sure your chicken pieces are small. This is often called karahi cut, which is 1 chicken cut into around 18 pieces. Basically, try not to use a large chicken (this recipe calls for 2-2.2 lbs) or large cuts.
                <br>You may use boneless chicken as well, though you’ll cook the chicken for a shorter time and spend a longer time sautéing out the moisture.
                <br><b>Note: </b>This recipe calls for around 2-2.2 lbs of chicken. Adjust salt, spices, etc. according to the amount of chicken you have. Also, if you’re only serving 2-3 people, you can use around 1 pound of chicken and halve the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h4>HOW TO MAKE KARAHI</h4>
            <p>Here’s what we’re trying to achieve at each step:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Heat the oil and brown the chopped onions.</b> Sauté the onions until they’re lightly golden. Then add garlic, ginger, and green chili pepper. The onions will deepen in color as the aromatics cook.</li>
                <li><b>Sauté the chicken.</b> This technique, called ‘bhunai‘ sears the meat and gives it richer flavor and color. A sprinkle of salt here helps layer the flavor.</li>
                <li><b>Add the tomatoes, spices, and salt. </b>The moisture from all the tomatoes will be enough to cook the chicken while keeping it moist.</li>
                <li><b>Cover & cook. </b>Allowing the chicken to slowly simmer while covered results in tender chicken and well-developed flavors. This also helps the tomatoes break down well.</li>
                <li><b>Uncover and stir-fry. </b>on high heat to sauté out the water content. You’re done once the chicken taking on a glossy appearance as the ghee/oil starts to separate.</li>
                <li><b>Stir in the yogurt. </b>I experimented with adding yogurt earlier but found I loved the pronounced taste and consistency it gives when added at the end. After adding the yogurt, continue to cook it through until the oil starts leaving the sides again.</li>
