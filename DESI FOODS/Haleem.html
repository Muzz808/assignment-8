        <h4>HOW TO MAKE HALEEM IN THE INSTANT POT</h4>
        <p>Here’s the plain and simple method broken down into 3 steps to give you an idea of how to make haleem in the Instant Pot. (If you’re new to the Instant Pot or just want to learn how to use it for Indian & Pakistani cooking, please check out my guide on How To Use The Instant Pot For Indian And Pakistani Cooking. For more Instant Pot recipes, I also have a collection of 15+ Easy Pakistani Instant Pot Recipes)</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b> Soak grains and lentils. Sauté onions, garlic, and ginger. Add the meat, sauté for a bit, then add the rest of the IP ingredients and pressure cook with the Meat/Stew Setting.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b> Open the Pot. Remove the beef and give it just enough pulses in the food processor to shred. Then use an immersion blender to blend the lentils & grains. If you don’t have an immersion blender, run the lentils and grains through the food processor too.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b> Add oats and cook the haleem down. Once it starts bubbling, cover and slow cook until you can see the ‘laced’ consistency (or resha). If you’re up for it, make a tadka. Garnish and serve!</li>

        <h4>HOW TO MAKE HALEEM ON THE STOVETOP</h4>
        <br>
        <p>If you’re making haleem on the stovetop, I’d suggest using my slow cooker haleem as a guide because the majority of it is done over the stovetop. I do plan on testing this on the stovetop and will update it when I do.</p>
