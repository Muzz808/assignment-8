        <h4>HOW TO MAKE FISH FRY RECIPE (STEPWISE PICTURES)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take all your ingredients for marinating fish. You need chilli powder, turmeric, coriander, garam masala powder, black pepper powder, ginger garlic paste, curry leaves, coriander leaves, lemon juice and salt.
                <br>I like to use a mix of kashmiri chilli powder and regular chilli powder. kashmiri chilli powder adds colour.
            </li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients given for marination together. I like to use a plate or a shallow bowl for mixing the marination.</li>
            <li>Add in lemon juice. Sometimes I add vinegar to the marination. It adds a tangy taste to the marination which is essential for fried fish.</li>
            <li>Mix the marination together with your hands. Make sure the marination doesn't turn too runny. You want it to be thick.</li>
            <li>Now you can see the marination looks dry. You may add a splash of water in this and mix. Since this doesn't have fish added yet, you can taste and check for seasoning.</li>
            <li>Add some water or more lemon juice to your marination to adjust the consistency.</li>
            <li>Now the marination masala is ready. It has to be thick like paste.</li>
            <li>Take your fish pieces. Since this is a whole fish, make deep slashes on the fish. The marination will penetrate through these gashes. You can use any fish like king fish steaks, seer fish or even anchovies.</li>
            <li>Apply the marination all over the fish. Apply evenly into the slashes.</li>
            <li>Let the fish marinate for minimum 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply the marination inside the fish as well.</li>
        </ol>
