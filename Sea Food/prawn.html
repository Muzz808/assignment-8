        <h4>Ingredient Notes: </h4>
        <img src="Prawn Images/ingredients.jpg" alt="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Oil -</b>You’ll need some olive oil or a mild flavored oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Butter -</b>I use unsalted butter to control the amount of sodium in my dishes, but salted butter works as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Garlic -</b> Lots of fresh minced garlic. Although you can use jarred garlic, fresh makes a difference in this recipe.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Shrimp -</b>I use large shrimp that is shelled and deveined. You can buy either fresh or frozen. I like to keep the tails on, easier to pick up, especially if served as an appetizer, but you can definitely remove the tails.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Salt -</b>Add salt to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Red Pepper Flakes -</b> A little bit of red pepper flakes will give this dish a little spice. Use as much or as little as you like.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Lemon Juice -</b>Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Parsley -</b>Chop some nice fresh parsley to finish off the dish.
            </li>
        </ul>
